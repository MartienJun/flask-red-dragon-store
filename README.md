# RED DRAGON POINT OF SALE WEB APP #

Simple point of sale app for an electronics store (I call it Red Dragon üêâ). 
This web base application was developed using the **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)** web framework, and 
for the user interface using the **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** framework. This application was created as a midterm exam project.

Note:
- When this application was created, Flask is still in version **1.1.x**
